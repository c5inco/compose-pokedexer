## Build Commands

- **Build the project**: `./gradlew build`
- **Run tests**: `./gradlew test`
- **Run instrumentation tests**: `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest`
- **Build debug APK**: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- **Build release APK**: `./gradlew assembleRelease`
- **Run benchmarks**: `./gradlew :benchmark:pixel4Api31BenchmarkAndroidTest`
- **Clean build**: `./gradlew clean`

## Architecture Overview

This is an Android Pokédex app built with **Jetpack Compose** and following modern Android development patterns:

### Technology Stack
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Hilt dependency injection
- **Database**: Room (local SQLite database)
- **Network**: Apollo GraphQL client connecting to PokéAPI
- **Navigation**: Compose Navigation
- **Image Loading**: Coil
- **Theming**: Material Kolor for dynamic theming

### Key Components

**Main Entry Points**:
- `MainActivity.kt` - Single activity with edge-to-edge display
- `PokedexerApp.kt` - Main Compose navigation graph and app structure
- `PokedexerApplication` - Hilt application class

**Data Layer**:
- `PokemonDatabase.kt` - Room database with DAOs for Pokemon, Moves, Items, and Abilities
- Repository pattern with separate repositories for each data type
- GraphQL queries in `app/src/main/graphql/` directory
- Local caching with Room database migrations (currently at version 6)

**UI Structure**:
- `ui/home/` - Main home screen with search functionality
- `ui/pokedex/` - Pokemon list and detail screens
- `ui/moves/` - Moves listing
- `ui/items/` - Items listing
- `ui/common/` - Shared UI components and utilities
- `ui/theme/` - App theming with Material 3

**Dependency Injection**:
- Hilt modules in `di/` directory for database, network, and repository setup
- NetworkModule configures Apollo client for GraphQL API

### Navigation Structure
- Home screen with search and menu navigation
- Nested navigation for Pokédex (list → details)
- Separate routes for Moves and Items
- Custom shared element transitions between screens

### Database Schema
- Pokemon entities with stats, types, evolutions, moves, and abilities
- Type converters for complex data structures (lists, custom objects)
- Auto-migrations handled by Room

### Testing
- Unit tests in `src/test/`
- Instrumentation tests in `src/androidTest/`
- Benchmark tests in separate `benchmark` module
- Database tests for Pokemon and Moves functionality
